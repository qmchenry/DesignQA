# UILint

The goal of this project is to ease the burden of making high quality user interfaces _just so_ both for developers and designers. Similar to a linter that monitors code for issues, UILint examines a UI at runtime to find potential issues.

The MVP of UILInt will examine a UIKIt, SwiftUI, or hybrid scene, check for several high-yield potential UI issues, and be able to report these findings to the user through a PDF shared from the device.

Please don't use this for real yet, but if you're interested in using it, consider [contributing](https://github.com/qmchenry/UILint/projects/1).

## Installation

UILint is a Swift Package that can be added directly to a project in XCode by clicking

`File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency`

and pasting this repository's url in the resulting search text field and clicking Next. On the next screen, select the version desired. Until there is a release, selecting the master branch is the simplest choice. Click Next and check that the default Add to Target setting makes sense. Click Finish and you're on your way to a lint-free UI!

## Usage

UILint usage is likely to change dramatically, but to get a feel right now, just `import UILint` in a UIViewController subclass of interest, and in the `viewDidLoad` function, add the line:

`let lint = UILint(view: view)` 

When the view loads, text representing the views in the scene will appear unceremoniously in the console. A PDF report can be generated and written to a file with

```swift
let pdfData = lint.makePDF()
try? pdfData.write(to: URL(fileURLWithPath: "/tmp/test.pdf"))
```

A demo UIKit app is available in the TestApps/ directory. It has been integrated with UILint and has these calls in place.
