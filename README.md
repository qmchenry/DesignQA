# UILint

ðŸš¨ Early Alpha ðŸš¨ _you've been warned_

Please don't use this for real yet, but if you're interested in using it, consider [contributing](https://github.com/qmchenry/UILint/projects/1).

The goal of this project is to ease the burden of making high quality user interfaces _just so_ both for developers and designers. Similar to a linter that monitors code for issues, UILint examines a UI at runtime to find potential issues.

The MVP of UILInt will examine a UIKIt, SwiftUI, or hybrid scene, check for several high-yield potential UI issues, and be able to report these findings to the user through a PDF shared from the device.
